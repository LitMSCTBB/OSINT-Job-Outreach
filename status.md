yo
basically



i got 250k free tokens per day so basically chilling unless im being stupid
if its really a problem will figure out how to manually scrape gpt

at the moment the strat is doing osint to handle deep research on each person to get most relevant info and doing a ton of prompt engineering

if it sucks may need to resort to finding something that just does normal linkedin / twitter  scrape

check out linkedin / twitter scrapers on github, and keep searching on x to see how people do this linkedin scraping or how they do these AUTOMATION MCP THINGS IN GENERAL. scrapegraphai looks good might be worth paying

I KNOW im being hella ocd but --- along with the osint output just find something that does linkedin scraping anyway so that i can quickly go over everything to make sure its alright.

THEN i need to find out how to find the people's emails. hoping deep research can output that.

then after that figure out how to send emails

4/17

debug everything so that i can leave it running overnight and do a ton of emails
set notifs for when things need my review and in the meantime start doing other things
run evals on certain things every so often and notify if something weird is going on


# pricing conundrums
this world is so stupid. either good linkedin data is blocked by linkedin scraping apis that charge a fuck ton

someone needs to do the math to see if doing browser use / some other cheaper hackaround method to get linkedin profiles is worth it in terms of how much gpt credits it is

same for emails
